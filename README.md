# AdonisJS/Inertia Implementation

## Issue

I've been attempting to implement Inertia with React in my project, but I've encountered m√πutliple bug but I am facing one that I can't resolve. When I navigate to my page I have a blank page and this error in my console

```
Home.jsx:1 Uncaught Error: @vitejs/plugin-react can't detect preamble. Something is wrong. See https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/pull/11#discussion_r430879201
    at Home.jsx:1:26
```

I attempted to apply a solution from [this discussion](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/1984#issuecomment-778289660 ), but unfortunately, it didn't solve the problem. At this point, I'm quite unsure about the next steps to take. If anyone has any insights or suggestions on how to address this issue, I would be eager to explore further and try to resolve it.
